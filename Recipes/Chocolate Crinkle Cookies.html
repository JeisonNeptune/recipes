    <h2> Ingredient List </h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Servings: 20 cookies</h3>
    <li><strong> 1/2 </strong>cup cocoa powder , (unsweetened)</li>
    <li><strong>1 </strong>cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li><strong>2 </strong>large eggs</li>
    <li><strong>1 </strong>tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li><strong>1 </strong>cup all purpose flour</li>
    <li><strong>1 </strong>tsp baking powder</li>
    <li><strong>1/4 </strong>tsp salt</li>
    <li><strong>1/2 </strong>cup confectioners sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Instructions </h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, cocoa powder, oil, vanilla extract and eggs. Whisk until the mixture is smooth</li>

    <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour together, baking powder and salt.</li>

    <li>Add the flour mixture to the cocoa mixture and stir to combine.</li>

    <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.</li>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 350F. Scoop dough with a mini ice cream scoop for even
         portioning into 20 cookies then roll cookie dough 
        into even-sized balls (it's easier to roll with wet hands) and generously roll each into powdered sugar.</li>

    <li>Place cookies on a baking sheet, being sure to leave space between each of the cookies. 
        Bake for 10-12 minutes, depending on the size of the cookies. 
        Cookies will come out soft but will harden as they cool down.</li>

    <li>Allow cookies to slightly cool. Then, move them to a wire rack to fully cool down. </li>
</ol>
