    <h3> Lemon Glazes:</h3>
  
        <li><strong>1</strong> cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> to 2 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice, or to reach desired consistency</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> tsp reserved lemon zest</li>

    </ul>
    <h2> Instructions </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 6 cup (8 1/2 by 4 1/2 bread loaf pan)* then dust with flour, tapping out the excess flour.</li>

    <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together: flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>

    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter and half of the granulated sugar on medium/high speed until combined then add the remaining sugar and beat for 2 minutes. 
        Beat in eggs, vanilla extract, and 1 tsp lemon zest and mix until well incorporated. </li>

    <li>Add flour mixture in 2 parts, alternating with the milk and mixing 
        on medium/low speed just until incorporated with each addition. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula as needed./li>

    <li>In a small bowl, toss blueberries with 1/2 Tbsp flour then fold them into the batter just until incorporated. Spread the batter into your prepared pan and bake for 50-60 min at 350°F until golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.*
         Let cool in pan for 10-15 minutes then run a cake release tool or knife around the edges and transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool completely before glazing.*</li>
       
    <li>After your bread is fully cooled, in a separate bowl, stir together powdered sugar, lemon juice, and reserved 1/2 tsp lemon zest. 
        Stir until smooth. It should have a drizzling consistency. Add more lemon juice to thin it out or powdered sugar to make it thicker.  </li>
  
</ol>
